# Cloud Atlas

A project that that reads cloud configurations and outputs graph data.
The goal is to make it easy to explore the graph to gain insight into how infrastructure is configured and connected.

## Status

* Only works with AWS.
* Only outputs a `dot` file with gnarly layouts

## Goals

[] Visualize graph in comprehensible layout
[] Make the graph explorable
[] Work across at least GCP, AWS, and Azure

This is intended to be a visual aide to help with discussions around design and triage.
It will build from the existing and actual cloud configurations as they are today.
